1. My programming skills have greatly improved.
I do believe I have a much better understanding of programming, particularly coming into the subject with almost no previous experience. Online learning has been very challenging for this subject, however.  
2. I am enthusiastic about programming.
It is cool when you actually successfully achieve what you are trying to program. However I find myself easily frustrated when I get stuck, particularly when I am so lost I don't even know how to begin even finding the problem.  
3. I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
I was able to do the first few WODs with no help at all. I think the last ones were harder but if I tried I would probably get there eventually. 
4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
The labs have been highly informative and detailed. I still find it more helpful going through the whole lab with the class rather than completing them on my own. 
5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
Probably not just yet - I am still not extremely confident in my ability to use everything we have learned on my own without referring to previous code. 
6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
I don't have any suggestions regarding the regular classes - I found it easy to keep up and everything was explained in detail and emphasised so I felt I retained a lot of information. The online classes I found it harder to keep up and communicate, particularly only having one laptop and trying to both do the class and the lab at the same time was tricky and annoying. 
7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class.
The important ideas and techniques are highly emphasised in the classes which has been very helpful. Going through the labs question by question as we have been is definitely the best way for me to learn and fully understand the concepts.
