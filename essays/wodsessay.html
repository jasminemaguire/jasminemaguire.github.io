The last WOD I completed was Invoice2. This WOD was quite short and simple as it was just an extension of Invoice1. 
This WOD only took me one attempt to Rx. I found it simple to just read through the instructions given and complete as they were relatively straightforward and there. 
To prepare I reattempted Invoice1 to get an Rx time. I found Invoice1 quite tough the first time and I think that reattempting it helped to solidify what code was required for certain instructions. Whilst I did have to refer to the screencast in Invoice1, I found that I could do Invoice2 on my own just by going through the instructions.  
The next WOD will be more challenging in that I will be starting from scratch; just as I did for Invoice1 and BrowserHistory1. I find these types of WODs require actively reading through the requirements before beginning the screencast and really thinking about what coding techniques are needed. I also think it is important to familiarise myself with what I need to do before I attempt it, and I even like to take my first attempt to take a breath and focus on what is required rather than getting the best time in order to not get overwhelmed.
